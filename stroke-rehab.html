            <h2 class="section-title">Project Overview</h2>
            <div class="text-content">
                <p>The Berkeley mixed reality stroke rehabilitation project is under Professor Sanjit A. Seshia's research group and partners with UCSF and Stanford hospitals. The goal of the project is to empower therapists and patients to conduct therapy sessions remotely using MR headsets like the Meta Quest 3 and create tailored exercise programs that report patient progress to therapists. My role as a researcher in the project is to lead and project manage the frontend, backend, and Unity applications.</p>
                
                <p>As project lead, I managed a team of 3-5 developers, including both student researchers and professional developers, coordinating tasks and timelines to ensure milestones were met. I designed and implemented systems across backend (Go, AWS), frontend (React, Typescript), and Unity (C#) codebases, integrating Agora video calling, Clerk authentication, AWS App runner & databases, and multi-provider AI (Gemini, OpenAI, Bedrock). I also prototyped the novel rehabilitation system using multimodal AI to generate and monitor personalized therapy exercises.</p>

                <h3>Key Features</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Remote therapy sessions conducted via video call between therapists on the web portal and patients on MR headset, providing therapists with a first-person view, 3D environment visualization, and real-time pose reconstruction.</li>
                    <li>Exercise programs created using natural language worksheets or recorded during therapy sessions, tailored to individual patient capabilities with automatic progress logging for therapist review.</li>
                    <li>Multimodal AI system that evaluates exercise performance using both real and virtual objects, providing automated feedback and adjustments.</li>
                    <li>End-to-end HIPAA compliant system ensuring patient data privacy and security throughout therapy sessions.</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="text-content">
                <p>I'm quite proud of the technical achievements and considerations made in this project. For those interested, I have some of my favorite highlights below and how they were implemented!</p>
                
                <h3>High Fidelity Terrain Modeling</h3>
                <p>
                    An important aspect of the simulation is accurate representation of terrain and road networks. Before students even play the wargame, they plan their evacuation based on a scenario brief. They must make considerations of where to place their medical platforms and treatment facilities based on road networks. They might ask themselves, "Will my ground vehicles that moves 60 mph be able to meet the one-hour evacuation standard for urgent patients with our proposed treatment site placement?" or "If the enemy blocks or destroys this road, will we be able to reroute?"</p>

                <p>
                    To meet this requirement, I used <a href="https://terraining.ateliernonta.com/">real life height data</a> that was imported and used in terrain tooling to provide accurate scaling and terrain features. The height of the terrain was exaggerated to better visualize elevation changes, as at the scale of hundreds of square kilometers, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C69xx2bM8IA">small elevation changes are almost impossible to see</a>!
                </p>

                <p>
                    For road placement, I sampled latitude/longitude coordinates from OpenStreetMap and converted them to Unity world space using a flat Earth approximation. The conversion accounts for latitude-dependent scaling of longitude:
                </p>

                <pre><code>public Vector2 ConvertPositionToLatLong(Vector3 pos) {
    float dx = (pos.x - refPoint.pos.x) / unitToKilometer;
    float dz = (pos.z - refPoint.pos.z) / unitToKilometer;
    
    float latKm = 111.32f;
    float lonKm = 111.32f * Mathf.Cos(refPoint.lat * Mathf.Deg2Rad);
    
    return new Vector2(
        refPoint.lat + (dz / latKm),
        refPoint.lon + (dx / lonKm)
    );
}</code></pre>

                <p>
                    Each sampled lat/long coordinate gets inserted into a spline node, and a custom mesh is generated along the spline to create the roads. This ensures in-game roads match real-world routes with accurate lengths and positioning.
                </p>
